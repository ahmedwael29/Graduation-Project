# Road Quality Assessment using IoT Technologies (Graduation Project)

## Project Overview

This project aims to assess the quality of roads by utilizing IoT (Internet of Things) technologies. The system collects real-time data from vehicle sensors and roadside infrastructure to evaluate road conditions. The data is processed to generate a road quality index (RQI), providing insights that can help improve road maintenance, reduce accidents, and enhance overall driving experiences.

## Features
- **Real-Time Data Collection:** Sensors gather data on road conditions (e.g., bumps, cracks, potholes) while vehicles are in motion.
- **Road Quality Index (RQI):** The system computes a quality score based on the collected data, providing insights into the state of the road.
- **Data Visualization:** A user-friendly dashboard displays road quality metrics on a map, enabling easy identification of problem areas.
- **Predictive Maintenance:** Historical data can be analyzed to predict road deterioration and optimize maintenance schedules.
- **Alerts:** Notifications are sent when road conditions reach critical levels, ensuring timely intervention.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware:** IoT sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS) for data collection.
- **Software:** 
  - C# (Backend development)
  - Python (Data analysis and machine learning)
  - React (Frontend development)
  - Flutter (Mobile Application)
  - SQL (Database)
- **Data Analytics:** Machine learning algorithms for predicting road quality trends.

## System Architecture

1. **Data Collection:** IoT sensors gather data from vehicles and road infrastructure.
2. **Data Transmission:** Data is sent to a cloud server via MQTT or other communication protocols.
3. **Data Processing:** Collected data is processed in real-time to calculate the RQI and detect road issues.
4. **Visualization:** The processed data is visualized on a web dashboard, with real-time updates on road conditions.
5. **Machine Learning:** Historical data is analyzed to predict future road quality and maintenance needs.
